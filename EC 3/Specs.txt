3. Write a program which defines total m integer numbers in pre-defined data area 'var_a'. Implement procedure 'gcd' which takes two argument in $a1 and $a0 and return GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) in $v0. Implement another procedure 'lcm' which takes two argument in $a1 and $a0 and return LCM (Least Common Multiplies) in $v0. This 'lcm' procedure uses 'gcd' procedure internally. Implement another procedure 'gcd_lcm_set' which takes two argument $a0 as address to the start of array var_a and $a1 as number of elements in the array. It returns GCD of the set of numbers in $v0 and LCM of the set of the number in $v1. The 'main' program prints GCD and LCM value of the given array of integer numbers in var_a. Name the program as gcd_lcm_arr.asm.
